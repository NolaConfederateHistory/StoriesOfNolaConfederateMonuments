# About Boogie B

Boogie B was a talented comedian, TikToker, and native of New Orleans who was tragically killed on December 23, 2023 while visiting home for the holidays. He was struck by a stray bullet while parked in a grocery store parking lot. Boogie B's career in comedy began when he was displaced to Washington, DC by Hurricane Katrina and he subsequently toured in New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. He then moved to Los Angeles to continue his career in comedy, where he gained a devoted following on social media through his "Hood History" series. This series focused on the history of New Orleans and made an effort to highlight Black history, using Boogie B's comedic abilities to infuse the videos with humor that entertained viewers while educating them. Boogie B's loss is a great one, not only to his family and friends, but to the entire New Orleans community. He will be deeply missed, but his warmth and spirit will live on through his work.
