## Erection of the Jefferson Davis Monument

Following the death of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederate States of America, memorial associations were formed across the South to create suitable monuments for him. The United Daughters of the Confederacy worked to create a large monument for Davis in Richmond, Virginia, while a New Orleans chapter formed the Jefferson Davis Memorial Association (JDMA) for the same purpose. The JDMA worked closely with the United Confederate Veterans and solicited subscriptions from the public for funding.

To fund the monument, the JDMA held auctions, sponsored plays, and solicited funds from the national organization of the Daughters of the Confederacy. The City of New Orleans donated land at the intersection of Canal Street and Jefferson Davis Parkway for the monument, and with help from the state legislature, the JDMA unveiled the finished monument in **1911**. The JDMA selected Virginian Edward Valentineto create the Davis monument after failing to raise the funds needed for Alexander Doyle.

Historians note that statues erected to Jefferson Davis were intended, in part, to repair his public image. The monument committee requested that Davis be made to appear “as a statesman, standing and addressing the people…” The statue, cast in bronze, stands just over eight feet tall and is mounted on a thirteen square foot granite pedestal. The front of the monument has raised text praising Davis as one of the “fittest men” of the South and “enshrined in the hearts of the people for whom he suffered.”

## Life and Legacy of Jefferson Davis

Jefferson Davis was named after Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father who was a political hero to Davis' father. Both Jefferson and Davis knew slavery could not survive, but neither did anything to abolish the practice, and both owned slaves. Davis attended West Point and later served in both houses of Congress and as secretary of war. As Southern losses in the Civil War mounted, Davis proposed emancipating slaves in late **1864** and early **1865** with a widely criticized plan to grant freedom to any slave willing to fight for the Confederacy. Davis is generally viewed by historians as a failure, largely because of a quick temper, an inability to navigate politics, and a willingness to reward friendship over competence.
  
Born in Kentucky, Davis about a year of his youth living in St. Mary Parish before the family moved to Mississippi. As a young man, Davis resigned from the military to marry Sarah Knox Taylor, daughter of future president Zachary Taylor. Tragically, three months into the marriage, both Davis and his wife contracted malaria or yellow fever, and his wife died. In **1889**, after completing his novel on the history of the Confederacy Davis took ill and was taken to New Orleans for treatment. His condition worsened, and Davis died at a friend's house in the Garden District on **December 6**.

## The Freedom Drum

In place of the controversial statue of Jefferson Davis at the intersection of Canal Street and Norman C. Francis Parkway in New Orleans, a vibrant art piece known as the "Freedom Drum" now stands as a symbol of unity, change, and justice. The creation of the [Level Artist Collective](http://levelartistcollective.com/), the Freedom Drum was unveiled in the week leading up to Juneteenth in **2021**.

Designed by local artists Rontherin Ratliff, Ana Hernandez, Horton Humble, John Isiah Walton, and Carl Joseph Williams, the Freedom Drum features figures standing tall with arms raised, supporting the skin of a Congo drum. Each figure is a cutout painted by a member of the Level Artist Collective, showcasing themes of racial freedom, equality, and justice.

The concept of the Freedom Drum was developed during conversations between Ratliff and muralist Brandan "B-mike" Odums in the summer of **2020**, following social protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. The artists drew inspiration from the acts of artistry and defiance performed by enslaved people in New Orleans' Congo Square, where they preserved their cultural traditions and heritage. Ratliff explained that the drum symbolizes the idea that individuals are instruments for change and communication, paralleling the role of artists and their visual platforms.

Each artist's cutout in the Freedom Drum represents unique aspects of the struggle for racial freedom and equality. For instance, Ana Hernandez's cutout includes imagery inspired by the Underground Railroad, constellations, the North Star quilt pattern, and the call for reparations. Horton Humble's piece features an oval-shaped shield over the figure's chest, symbolizing spiritual and internal tools for change, as well as armor made of Afro picks and waves to represent protection and movement.

The Level Artist Collectiveformed in **2015**, and its members have supported one another throughout their artistic journeys. Despite challenges in coordinating schedules and creating the Freedom Drum, the artists successfully produced a powerful representation of unity and change. Originally planned for a short display, the sculpture has remained in place due to support from Mayor LaToya Cantrell and the community, and will stay until the weather no longer permits or an alternative decision is made.
