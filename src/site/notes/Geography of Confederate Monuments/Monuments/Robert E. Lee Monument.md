# Why the Robert E. Lee statue was erected

The Robert E. Lee statue was erected in 1884 by the Robert E. Lee Monumental Association, a group of prominent white New Orleanians and Civil War veterans. The monument was dedicated to Confederate General Robert E. Lee, who was regarded by many Americans, north and south, as the epitome of military brilliance, bravery, and loyalty. The Association raised the funds for the statue through public donations and solicitation, accomplishing their work with remarkable speed compared to other Civil War monument committees. The plan for the monument was ambitious, consisting of a massive earthen foundation, granite pyramid base, and a sixty-foot marble column topped with a bronze statue of Lee himself, created by artist [[Need to Add/Alexander Doyle\|Alexander Doyle]]. The statue stands sixteen and a half feet tall and weighs over three tons. The Lee statue quickly became a prominent landmark in New Orleans and was the site of civic celebrations, Civil War reunions, and other public events, often glorifying the Confederacy. Despite the monument's historical significance, in recent years, many New Orleans residents have protested its glorification of slavery, racism, white supremacy, and oppression.

# Why the Robert E. Lee statue was taken down

In recent years, there has been increasing debate and protests over the Robert E. Lee statue and its significance in New Orleans. Many New Orleans residents view the statue and other Confederate monuments as symbols of slavery, racism, white supremacy, and oppression. After a 6-1 vote by the City Council in 2015, the statue was one of four Confederate monuments scheduled to be removed. Governor Bobby Jindal opposed the removals. On December 17, 2015, the New Orleans City Council voted to relocate four statues from public display, including the Robert E. Lee statue in Lee Circle. Four organizations immediately filed a lawsuit in federal court, and the city administration agreed that no monument removals would take place before a court hearing scheduled for January 14, 2016. In January 2016, a contractor hired by the city to remove the monuments backed out of his contract after receiving death threats. The lawsuit continued until March 6, 2017, when a three-judge panel of the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously held the City of New Orleans should be enjoined no further and could proceed forward with the removal of the three monuments. Finally, on May 19, 2017, the Robert E. Lee statue was removed in the middle of the day, amid celebration and protest. The city plans to store the monument in a warehouse until a permanent location can be determined.

# The Legacy of Robert E Lee

The Robert E. Lee Monument in New Orleans has been a source of controversy due to the complicated legacy of its namesake. While Lee is widely regarded as a skilled military tactician and leader, he is also associated with the Confederacy and the defense of slavery. In recent years, there have been calls to remove Confederate monuments, including the statue of Lee, which many argue represent symbols of racism and oppression.

One interesting aspect of the Lee statue in New Orleans is that Lee had very little personal connection to the city. He never lived there, and his military service brought him to the area only a few times. The decision to erect the statue was made by a group of prominent white New Orleanians who were members of the Robert E. Lee Monumental Association, many of whom had served in the Confederacy.

# Sentinel

In its place, a sculpture by artist Simone Leigh, titled Sentinel (Mami Wata), was installed on January 22, 2022, as part of the Prospect.5 art exhibition. The sculpture, more than 12 feet tall, celebrates the traditions of the African diaspora in New Orleans and honors the work done by activists and city officials to remove symbols of white supremacy.

Sentinel (Mami Wata) takes inspiration from African folklore and spiritualities, particularly the water deity Mami Wata, known under many names across the African diaspora. The sculpture's design includes a snake wrapped around a slender female form resembling a spoon, which references the Zulu culture's symbol of status. The sculpture's placement at ground level, rather than atop a pedestal, is intentional and seeks to de-center whiteness and the legacies of colonialism.

The sculpture, which remained at Égalité Circle until July 2022, is considered the grand finale of the Prospect.5 art exhibition, and its placement marked a new historical perspective for the site. The exhibition's statement says that the sculpture holds forms of knowledge passed down through spiritual and masking traditions of the city and beyond, signifying transformation and renewal of access to culture and knowledge suppressed by the falsehoods of white supremacy.

Sentinel (Mami Wata) has received critical acclaim for its celebration of African diaspora traditions and its subversion of the power dynamics represented by the former Robert E. Lee Monument. The sculpture's placement at Égalité Circle represents one point in a larger constellation of public art, conversation, and historical memory.
