# The Life of Maragaret Haughery

Margaret Haughery **(1813-1882**), an Irish immigrant widow, was a prominent philanthropist in 19th-century New Orleans. Dedicated her life to feeding the poor and funding and building orphanages throughout the city. Margaret worked closely with the Sisters of Charity and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans.

Born in poverty and orphaned at a young age, Margaret began her adult life as a washwoman and peddler, eventually becoming a businesswoman and philanthropist. She opened four orphanages in New Orleans, some of which later evolved into homes for the elderly in the 20th and 21st centuries. 

In the **1850s**, during a yellow fever epidemic, Margaret cared for victims regardless of race or creed. She expanded her charity work by opening St. Theresa's Orphan Asylum and investing in a dairy and bakery business, which helped fund the orphanages. Her bakery, Margaret Haughery & Company, became the first steam bakery in the South and earned her the title "Bread Woman of New Orleans."

During the Civil War, Margaret provided food and assistance to those affected by the conflict, earning the respect and admiration of people from all walks of life in New Orleans. Despite facing numerous personal tragedies, she dedicated her life to helping widows, orphans, and the destitute in her adopted city.

# Erection of the Margaret Haughery Statue

Upon her death in **1882**, Margaret's estate was mostly donated to charity. In the following months, a committee called the Margaret Monumental Fund Committee was formed to raise money for a statue in her honor. The committee included prominent individuals like Fred Ogden, also known as [[Need to Add/General Ogden\|General Ogden]], who had been the commander-in-chief of the Crescent City White League during the [[Geography of Confederate Monuments/Monuments/Battle of Liberty Place Monument#Historical Background on the Battle of Liberty Place\|Battle of Liberty Place]] in **1874**. The committee raised $6,000 in small donations to commission the statue, deliberately declining large contributions.

Young sculptor [[Need to Add/Alexander Doyle\|Alexander Doyle]] was chosen to create the statue, which was based on photographs of Margaret. He first molded it in clay before sending it to Italy to be reproduced in Carrara marble. The statue was initially rejected by the commission due to imperfections in the marble, but a second block was procured, and the final statue was completed by **May 1884**. The monument was unveiled on **July 9, 1884**, at the intersection of Camp and Prytania streets, now known as Margaret Place. The ceremony was attended by children from every orphanage in the city, New Orleans Mayor J. Valsin Guillotte, members of the city council, and other dignitaries.

# Complicated Legacy

Margaret Haughery's legacy, like that of many prominent 19th-century New Orleanians, is complex. While she was celebrated for her philanthropy and dedication to orphaned children, she was not apolitical. Her post-Civil War philanthropy included support for the [[Need to Add/White League\|White League]], a white supremacist organization that terrorized Black people and briefly overthrew the state government during a violent episode in Reconstruction. Haughery's bakery advertised in the Daily Democrat newspaper, the official journal of the city and state government, which was aligned with the White League during Reconstruction. In **1874**, she donated baked goods to the White League after their attack on the integrated Metropolitan Police in New Orleans, known as the Battle of Liberty Place. While her ties to the White League are not mentioned on the placard near her statue, her connection to the group, as well as the involvement of White League leader Fred Ogden in the effort to create her statue, add a layer of complexity to her legacy as a philanthropist and friend to orphans.
