# Historical Background on the Battle of Liberty Place 

The Battle of Liberty Place, also known as the Battle of Canal Street, took place on **September 14, 1874**, in New Orleans, Louisiana. This event was an attempted insurrection and coup d'etat by the [[Need to Add/Crescent City White League\|Crescent City White League]] against the Reconstruction Era Louisiana Republican state government. The White League, a paramilitary organization comprised mostly of Confederate veterans, sought to overthrow the Republican government that aimed to provide greater equality and opportunities for Black Americans. The conflict arose from the disputed **1872** gubernatorial election in Louisiana, where both Democrat John McEnery and Republican William Pitt Kellogg claimed victory. The battle resulted in the White League temporarily taking control of the statehouse, armory, and downtown New Orleans for three days. They retreated upon the arrival of Federal troops sent by President Ulysses S. Grant, which ultimately restored the elected government.

# Erection of the Monument 
The Battle of Liberty Place Monument was erected on **September 14, 1891**, the seventeenth anniversary of the battle, as a memorial to the White League members who participated in the insurrection. The monument was initially placed at the foot of Canal Street, near the site of the battle, and featured an obelisk with inscriptions praising the actions of the White League. The dedication of the monument was attended by a large gathering of Confederate veterans, local officials, and community members. The monument's placement and construction were meant to not only commemorate the events of the battle but also to convey a message of white supremacy and reinforce the racial hierarchy in the post-Reconstruction South.

Over the years, the monument's location and appearance underwent several changes. In **1932**, due to the construction of a traffic tunnel, the monument was relocated to the neutral ground near the intersection of Iberville and Badine Streets. In **1974**, the original inscription on the monument, which praised the actions of the White League, was replaced with a plaque acknowledging the event as part of the "racial troubles" of the Reconstruction era. Despite these changes, the monument continued to be a source of controversy as it still symbolized and celebrated the white supremacist ideals of the [[Need to Add/White League\|White League]].

# Removal 

On December 17, 2015, the New Orleans City Council voted 6-1 to declare the Battle of Liberty Place Monument and three other Confederate statues public nuisances and approved their removal. This decision was met with legal challenges from various preservationist groups, which temporarily halted the removal process. After several court rulings upheld the city's decision, the Battle of Liberty Place Monument was finally taken down on **April 24, 2017**, with workers wearing masks and bulletproof vests to protect their identities due to threats received by contractors involved in the removal process.
