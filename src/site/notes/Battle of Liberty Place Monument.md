# Historical Background 

The Battle of Liberty Place, also known as the Battle of Canal Street, took place on September 14, 1874, in New Orleans, Louisiana. This event was an attempted insurrection and coup d'etat by the Crescent City White League against the Reconstruction Era Louisiana Republican state government. The White League, a paramilitary organization comprised mostly of Confederate veterans, sought to overthrow the Republican government that aimed to provide greater equality and opportunities for Black Americans. The conflict arose from the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election in Louisiana, where both Democrat John McEnery and Republican William Pitt Kellogg claimed victory. The battle resulted in the White League temporarily taking control of the statehouse, armory, and downtown New Orleans for three days. They retreated upon the arrival of Federal troops sent by President Ulysses S. Grant, which ultimately restored the elected government.

# Erection of the MonumentÂ 

The Battle of Liberty Place Monument was erected on September 14, 1891, the seventeenth anniversary of the battle, as a memorial to the White League members who participated in the insurrection. The monument was initially placed at the foot of Canal Street, near the site of the battle, and featured an obelisk with inscriptions praising the actions of the White League. The dedication of the monument was attended by a large gathering of Confederate veterans, local officials, and community members. The monument's placement and construction were meant to not only commemorate the events of the battle but also to convey a message of white supremacy and reinforce the racial hierarchy in the post-Reconstruction South.

Over the years, the monument's location and appearance underwent several changes. In 1932, due to the construction of a traffic tunnel, the monument was relocated to the neutral ground near the intersection of Iberville and Badine Streets. In 1974, the original inscription on the monument, which praised the actions of the White League, was replaced with a plaque acknowledging the event as part of the "racial troubles" of the Reconstruction era. Despite these changes, the monument continued to be a source of controversy as it still symbolized and celebrated the white supremacist ideals of the White League.
