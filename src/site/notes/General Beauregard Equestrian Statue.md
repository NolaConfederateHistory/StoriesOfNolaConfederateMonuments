# Erection of Beauregard Equestrian Statue

The General Beauregard Equestrian Statue was erected on November 11, 1915, in New Orleans, Louisiana. The statue was commissioned by the Louisiana Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) to honor the memory P.G.T. Beauregard, a prominent Confederate General during the American Civil War. The American sculptor Alexander Doylewas chosen to create the statue, which depicted General Beauregard on horseback.
  
Standing at the entrance of City Park on Esplanade Avenue, the statue was a powerful symbol of Beauregard's military prowess and dedication to the Confederacy. The equestrian statue was cast in bronze, and its pedestal, made of granite, featured the Confederate seal, along with inscriptions honoring Beauregard's service during the Civil War.

However, the statue faced criticism and controversy in the 21st century due to its association with the Confederacy and the era of racial segregation. As a result, in 2017, the city of New Orleans decided to remove the statue from its public location. The removal process was conducted under the cover of darkness to protect the workers from potential backlash.

# Time Capsule

During the removal of the General Beauregard Equestrian Statue, a time capsule was discovered within the base of the monument. Dating back to 1913, the capsule was a copper box that had been soldered shut to preserve its contents.

On June 1, 2018, the time capsule was opened, revealing a collection of artifacts and documents that provided a glimpse into the past. Among the items found were Confederate currency, badges from various Confederate veterans' organizations, photographs of prominent Confederate figures, and several documents related to the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

In particular, the capsule contained a letter dated August 2, 1913, from the UDC to the future generations of New Orleans. The letter expressed the hope that the city's citizens would continue to honor and remember the sacrifices made by Beauregard and his fellow Confederate soldiers. Additionally, the letter mentioned the statue's creation as a response to the growing trend of erecting monuments to Union heroes.
